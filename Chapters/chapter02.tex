\chapter{Literature Overview}
\label{ch:literature_overview}
This chapter will cover research and theory about existing technology that covers similar research fields as this project. 
It will cover three areas.
First an introduction to learning analytics.
Second an overview of existing positioning systems, both for indoor and outdoor positioning.
Third some similar research conducted by others.

\section{Learning Analytics} 
Learning analytics can be described as using data about learning patterns and activity to provide new insights into educational practices and to improve learning, teaching and decision-making \citep{Siemens2012}
At the \textit{1st International Conference on Learning Analytics \& Knowledge} in 2011 learning analytics was defined as: \textit{``Learning analytics is the measurement, collection, analysis and reporting of data about learners and their contexts, for purposes of understanding and optimising learning and the environments in which it occurs.''} \citep{BuckinghamShum2012}.


\subsection*{Multimodal Learning Analytics}
Multimodal Learning Analytics is described as using multiple data sources for extracting data from a learning situation, that can be used to predict, understand and quantify student learning \citep{Worsley2010}.
It has later been defined by \citet{Worsley2016} as: \textit{``Multimodal learning analytics (MMLA) sits at the intersection of three ideas: multimodal teaching and learning, multimodal data, and computer-supported analysis. At its essence, MMLA utilizes and triangulates among non-traditional as well as traditional forms of data in order to characterize or model student learning in complex learning environments.''}

\section{Positioning Systems}
The literature on positioning systems can be split in two categories: outdoor positioning and indoor positioning.
