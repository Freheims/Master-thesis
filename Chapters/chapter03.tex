This chapter describes the research methodologies, methods and frameworks used in this research project.

\section{Research Question}

\todo{Insert research question here}

\section{Design Science}
Design Science research is a research methodology which establishes and uses research when the goal is an artifact or a recommendation.
Research based on design science can be performed in an organizational context and an academic environment \citep{lacerda2015design}.
As the goal of this project is to create and evaluate an artifact the design science methodology fits well with my goal which is why I choose to use it.

\citet{hevner2004design} claims that design is both a process and a artifact.
The design process produces an innovative artifact, which is evaluated to provide feedback about the artifact itself, and a better understanding of the problem. 
This information is used to improve both the artifact itself and the design process.

Design Science is a problem solving process.
The foundation on which design science is based is that knowledge about and understanding of a design problem, and the solution to that problem, is something you achieve through the development and use of an artifact.
Artifacts as a result of design science is according to \citet{March1995} \textit{constructs}, \textit{models}, \textit{methods}, and \textit{instantiations}.

\todo{Add more about how and why I use design science}

\subsection{Artifacts}
Within design science there are as stated four types of artifact.
Artifacts are created to address unsolved problems, and when they are evaluated by looking at the utility they provide in solving the problem.
\citet[p.78-79]{hevner2004design} defines those four artifacts as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Constructs}: provides the language, vocabulary and concepts, which is used to define and communicate the problems and solutions.
	\item \textit{Models}: is a representation of a real world situation of the design problem and its solution space created using constructs. They help with the understanding of the problem and the solution, and is often used to represent the connection between them. 
	\item \textit{Methods}: provide guidance on how to search the solution space and solve problems.
	\item \textit{Instantiations}: is an implementation of a construct, model or method in a working system.
\end{enumerate}

In this project the main artifact is the back end part of the system which determines the movements of the fire fighters based on the collected data.

\subsection{Guidelines}
\citet{hevner2004design} defines a set of seven guidelines for implementing and evaluating design science research.
Those guidelines and their definitions are listed in table~\ref{tab:design-science-guidelines}.

\begin{table}[ht]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{0.4\linewidth}|p{0.6\linewidth}|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Guideline} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
	Guideline 1: Design as an Artifact & Design-science research must produce a viable artifact in the form of a construct, a model, a method, or an instantiation. \\ \hline
	Guideline 2: Problem relevance & The objective of design-science research is to develop technology-based solutions to important and relevant business problems. \\ \hline
	Guideline 3: Design evaluation & The utility, quality, and efficacy of a design artifact must be rigorously demonstrated via well-executed evaluation methods. \\ \hline
	Guideline 4: Research contributions & Effective design-science research must provide clear and verifiable contributions in the areas of the design artifact, design foundations, and/or design methodologies. \\ \hline
	Guideline 5: Research rigor & Design-science research relies upon the application of rigorous methods in both the construction and evaluation of the design artifact. \\ \hline
	Guideline 6: Design as a search process & The search for an effective artifact requires utilizing available means to reach desired ends while satisfying laws in the problem environment. \\ \hline
	Guideline 7: Communication of research & Design-science research must be presented effectively both to technology-oriented as well as management-oriented audiences. \\ \hline

\section{Prototyping}
A prototype is a early version of a product. 
It is supposed to demonstrate some features or properties of an artifact which can be evaluated and analyzed to gain some understanding about how the product can be revised in the next iteration of the development \citep{oates2005researching}.
There are two types of prototypes: \textit{low-fidelity-prototype} and \textit{high-fidelity-prototype}

Low-fidelity prototyping is a way of translating high-level designs into testable artifacts \citep{Babich2017}.
The purpose of a low-fidelity prototype is to test and check functionality, not visual designs and appearances.
In a low-fidelity prototype only the most important elements of the content is included, and only general visual attributes are presented.

High-fidelity prototypes looks and functions as similar to the actual product as possible \citep{Babich2017}.
They are usually created when there is a solid understanding of the final product available and it needs to be tested on actual users.
In a high-fidelity prototype most of the content is included, and the design is realistic with all details in place.
