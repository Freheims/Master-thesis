\label{ch:conclusion}
This chapter presents a summary of the research presented in this thesis, limitations of the research project, and suggestions on what could be done in the future.

\section{Conclusions}
Design Science Research was used to develop FireTracker, a system for tracking firefighters while exercising smoke diving.
The system was developed through three iterations, and the prototype created during those iterations was evaluated.
This prototype consisted of three components: an Android application for collecting data, a back-end for processing data, and an exercise management tool for creating and presenting data.
The two first components are presented in this thesis, but all of them are interrelated and was evaluated together.

In the first iteration the requirements for the system was established.
