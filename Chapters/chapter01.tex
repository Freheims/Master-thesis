Today we have pretty good systems for outdoor localization, positioning and tracking using the Global Positioning System (GPS). 
Unfortunately GPS does not work well enough indoors when you need precise locations
There are however developed several other projects for indoor localization and tracking using different technologies such as light \citep{xiaohan2010improved}, sound \citep{schweinzer2010ultrasonic}, WIFI  \citep{chang2010robust} and Bluetooth \todo{Find reference},
