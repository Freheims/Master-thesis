@article{Shum2012,
abstract = {15.3.3?seq=1&cid=pdf-reference#references_tab_contents You may need to log in to JSTOR to access the linked references. JSTOR is a not-for-profit service that helps scholars, researchers, and students discover, use, and build upon a wide range of content in a trusted digital archive. We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. ABSTRACT We propose that the design and implementation of effective Social Learning Analytics (SLA) present significant challenges and opportunities for both research and enterprise, in three important respects. The first is that the learning landscape is extraordinarily turbulent at present, in no small part due to technological drivers. Online social learning is emerging as a significant phenomenon for a variety of reasons, which we review, in order to motivate the concept of social learning. The second challenge is to identify different types of SLA and their associated technologies and uses. We discuss five categories of analytic in relation to online social learning; these analytics are either inherently social or can be socialised. This sets the scene for a third challenge, that of implementing analytics that have pedagogical and ethical integrity in a context where power and control over data are now of primary importance. We consider some of the concerns that learning analytics provoke, and suggest that Social Learning Analytics may provide ways forward. We conclude by revisiting the drivers and trends, and consider future scenarios that we may see unfold as SLA tools and services mature.},

abstract = {The first workshop on Multimodal Learning Analytics took place in 2012 at the International Conference of Multimodal Interaction in Santa Monica, California. Since then researchers have been organizing annual workshops, tutorials, webinars, conferences and data challenges. This paper examines the body of research that has emerged from these workshops, as well as in other published proceedings and journals. Within this review, a distinction is drawn between empirical and position/review/dataset papers, and looks at their rate of publication over the past several years. Additionally, key characteristics of empirical papers as well as current trends from non-empirical papers provide key insights from which to reflect on the progress of MMLA to date, and identify potential future opportunities. Specifically this review suggests that greater attention should be paid to using deep learning, developing simpler data collection tools, and finding ways to use MMLA to support accessibility.},

While design has gained a strong foothold in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction design research within HCI. Following a research through design approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the world from its current state to a preferred state. This model allows interaction designers to make research contributions based on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples to illustrate the benefits of this type of research.

abstract = {Abstract Wireless networks have displaced the well established and widely deployed wired communication networks of the past. Tetherless access and new services offered to mobile users contribute to the popularity of these networks. Thus users have access from many locations and can roam ubiquitously. The knowledge of the physical location of mobile user devices, such as phones, laptops and PDAs, is important in several applications such as network planning, location based services, law enforcement and for improving network performance. A device's location is usually estimated by monitoring a distance dependent parameter such as wireless signal strength from a base station whose location is known. In practical deployments, signal strength varies with time and its relationship to distance is not well defined. This makes location estimation difficult. Many location estimation or localization schemes have been proposed for networks adopting a variety of wireless technologies. This paper reviews a broad class ...},
