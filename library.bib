@article{Pandey2006,
abstract = {Abstract Wireless networks have displaced the well established and widely deployed wired communication networks of the past. Tetherless access and new services offered to mobile users contribute to the popularity of these networks. Thus users have access from many locations and can roam ubiquitously. The knowledge of the physical location of mobile user devices, such as phones, laptops and PDAs, is important in several applications such as network planning, location based services, law enforcement and for improving network performance. A device's location is usually estimated by monitoring a distance dependent parameter such as wireless signal strength from a base station whose location is known. In practical deployments, signal strength varies with time and its relationship to distance is not well defined. This makes location estimation difficult. Many location estimation or localization schemes have been proposed for networks adopting a variety of wireless technologies. This paper reviews a broad class ...},
