\chapter*{Abstract}
This master thesis explores how Bluetooth Low Energy beacons can be used for indoor tracking of firefighters in a smoke diving exercise situation.
It investigates how the technology can be used, what kind of data it could provide, and how useful the data is for the evaluation of the exercise.
To do this a prototype system for tracking firefighters called \textit{FireTracker} is developed.
The system consists of three components, an Android application for collecting data, a back-end for processing and serving data, and an exercise management tool for creating and viewing exercise sessions.
This system is evaluated through technical testing, and evaluation by both smoke diving instructors and smoke divers from the fire department.
The evaluation shows that there is potential for a system like FireTracker, but the currently available technology needs some improvement before it could actually be used.
